It was somewhat confusing at first though because the tripled artwork made it seem as if there were three top songs all on the same album/by the same artist. Might be cool to put a dark filter on the left and right album images or something.","Nope. I do wish there were a text box telling me how far back or forwards I was going in the song when I clicked the arrow button.","Yeah, for sure. They'd likely be looking for more than just the top song, but it seems like a great tool to place songs to their year!","Nope. I was able to create an account, login out and log back in just fine. Encountered no trouble playing songs. Did not try to export a playlist.","This isn't really a feature I'd like to see added but I noticed that even when I was logged in, there was a text box on the home screen (entitled ""You!"") that encouraged me to sign up/make an account. Might be confusing to have this on there even when someone is logged in.","No"

I also like the popup registration.","I thought that I would be able to click the song and just play it at the bottom left where it shows the icons of all the songs on the list; however, I have to continually press the next button to get to a song","Yes, I think it would be really helpful to get a quick selection of the top hits from any year, and being able to listen to them is a plus.","The create a playlist feature seemed bugged.","Skipping to a song by clicking on its icon.","No"
